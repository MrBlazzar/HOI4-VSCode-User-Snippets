# HOI4-VSCode-User-Snippets
Simple code snippets for Hearts of Iron 4 Modding in Visual Studio Code
Some code snippets I've made for Visual Studio Code CWTools for HOI4

I use these with these two plugins:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=tboby.cwtools-vscode
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=andersosthus.paradox-syntax

Will it work with others? No idea good luck.

## Installation Instructions

### Option 1: Copy File
- Download the .json file and directly place it in your snippets directory 
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets`
  - Linux: `~\.config\Code\User\snippets`
  - Mac: Should be the same as linux so `~\.config\Code\User\snippets` don't quote me on that though
- Make sure to keep the name hoi4.json, as VSCode won't recognize it for use with the extension otherwise

### Option 2: Directly Copy Code
- Open VSCode and go to `File > Preferences > User Snippets`
- Type `hoi4.json` into the newly opened command palette
- Copy all the code from this repo's `hoi4.json` into the file
